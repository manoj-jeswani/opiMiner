<b>A client had to wait for a finite amount of time before the requested page loads, because the server<br> 
was busy in fetching API call results and downloading client requested files from somewhere else.<br>
=> Solved the issue and improved end user's experience by making use of Celery, RabbitMq and Redis to carry out<br> 
time consuming processes in the background, meanwhile the user is entertained with other services and is shown progress of ongoing processes.</b>
